# DVRPC Bike LTS Analysis Map
## About
    An update to the [existing](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/BikeStress/) LTS map that will improve performance, add more features and streamline the user experience. We will be moving away from the existing AGO platform into a custom solution built with [mapboxgl js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.3.1/) and custom vector tiles.

## Development
    - Map template float-wide starting point
    - vanilla, mapbox, etc

## Deployment
