                    <p>LTS is a road classification scheme based on the estimated comfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream. DVRPC’s LTS assignment is based on the <strong>number of lanes</strong>, effective <strong>vehicle speed</strong>, and the presence and type of <strong>bicycle facility</strong> on the road segment.</p>
                    <p>This table summarizes LTS in terms of the cyclist type that would be comfortable on certain levels and the characteristics of those levels. Generally, as the colors indicate, the higher the LTS, the more dangerous or the greater the perceived danger, and the more confident the cyclist needs to feel on their bike to consider riding on that type of road.</p>
                    <p>A few surveys have shown that the Interested but Concerned group is the largest, and therefore, a lot of bicycle infrastructure planning is done with them in mind.</p>

                    <p>The map shows the DVRPC Region’s road segments colored by their LTS assignment. As indicated by the colors on the map, divided highways and major arterials are often higher stress, while local, residential streets often present the lowest stress. Trails and off-road paths are considered non-stressful in this analysis.</p>

                    <p>If we look at just the LTS 1 and 2 roads, those that are comfortable for most cyclists, you start to see gaps in the network, creating low-stress islands. If an interested but concerned cyclist starts their trip on one of these islands, and they are uncomfortable using the higher LTS roads that connect them, this person is limited to their island. If they want to travel off their island, they are unlikely to ride their bike.</p>

                    <p>We know that in reality, there is no way to make improvements to all the LTS 3 roads in the region at the same time. Thus, the point of our connectivity analysis was to be able to rank the LTS 3 roads and compare them to each other, to see which would enable the most low stress connections; essentially give us the most bang for our buck.</p>

                    <p>The goal was to compare the connectivity benefit of each of the LTS 3 roads. Using a shortest path algorithm, we identified the shortest path from every census block in the region, to every other census block within five miles.

                    <p>We tallied the number of shortest paths that use each road segment. We also weighted the paths using information about the populations that live near the origin or destination.</p>
                    <p>DVRPC maintains an <a href="/webmaps/ipd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indicators of Potential Disadvantage (IPD)</a> analysis that identifies populations of interest under Title VI and Environmental Justice (youth, older adults, female, racial minority, ethnic minority, foreign-born, limited english proficiency, disabled, low-income). The IPD score classifies the concentration of the population groups of interest on a scale from “well below average” to “well above average” in every census tract in the region.</p>
                    <p>To allow us to view the connectivity results through an equity lens, IPD scores were converted to a numerical scale and origins and destinations were weighted by their corresponding numerical IPD score.  Paths connecting two places with above average concentrations of populations of interest were worth more than those connecting places with below average concentrations. Thus, the results can help identify the road segments that would have the greatest potential community impact if made more comfortable for bicyclists.</p>
                    <p>The thicker the <em>magenta</em> line, the more shortest paths use that road segment. Using these results, we can identify the LTS 3 road segments that would be used to enable the most low-stress connections if made more comfortable. The segments highlighted in <em>dark purple</em> are the LTS 3 roads used by the most shortest paths. These results are relative to the rest of the LTS 3 roads. Since shortest paths were calculated on a network including all LTS 3 roads, the number of connections enabled by each segment is based on every LTS 3 road being part of the low-stress network.</p>
                    <p>Since we know this is impossible, these results serve to rank the LTS 3 roads by their relative potential impact and serve as a pipeline of realistic beneficial projects. Essentially, the results are a screening tool that can help us narrow down where to look to make improvements.</p>

Since the shortest paths were calculated between census blocks, more shortest paths started and ended in more dense places, therefore inflating the number of paths in urban areas. We chose to prioritize the top 10% in each county to ensure the urban counties did not dominate the results.</p>

                    <p>The connectivity analysis tallies the number of calculated paths that use each road segment. Similar to the census block to census block analysis, more shortest paths traveled through areas with a high density of special destinations (schools, trails, and transit stops), therefore increasing the number of highly traveled segments in these areas.</p>
                    <h3 class="scene-subheader">LTS 4 Segments</h3>
                    <p>Road segments are prioritized based on the assumption that the LTS 3 segments used the most would enable the most low-stress connections if improvements were made to them to make them more comfortable for cyclists. LTS 3 segments were chosen for prioritization because it is assumed that they would be easier to make comfortable than LTS 4 segments. Computationally, it is also significantly more efficient to calculate paths without LTS 4 segments included.</p>
                    <p>However, there are many LTS 4 segments that have the potential to provide substantial low-stress network connectivity benefits. Future versions of this analysis will aim to incorporate all bike-able roads in the connectivity analysis.</p>
